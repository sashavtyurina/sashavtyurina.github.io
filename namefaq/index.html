    <p class="faqquestion">
      Q: Psst, so I heard your name <em>actually</em> is Sasha, and not Alexandra. Is that true?
    </p>
    <p>Yes and no. But mostly no. I grew up in Russia, where you can't go through your day without running into an Alexander or an Alexandra. But here's the catch that causes much confusion among English speakers — a diminutive for both names is Sasha. Yes, boys and girls are called Sashas.</p>
    <p>When I first visited North America, I felt obliged to tell the whole Alexandra-Sasha story, which caused perplexed looks every time without a fail. In an attempt to minimize those, I started introducing myself as Alex. Until one day I joined a group where there was already an Alex, so I went back to Sasha.</p>

    <p class="faqquestion">Q: So which one do you prefer — Alexandra, Sasha, or Alex?</p>
    <p>Most people now call me Sasha. I use Alexandra for official purposes and papers. There is a group of friends where I am still known as Alex. You are welcome to use any of the above, but be prepared for possible misunderstandings when talking to others.</p>

    <p class="faqquestion">Q: But it doesn't make any sense, why would Alexandra and Sasha be the same name?</p>
    <p>Good question. I never did a deep enough research to answer it, but I might one day. For now accept that some things just are.</p>

    <p class="faqquestion">Q: Err... How do I pronounce your last name?</p>
    <p>This task is not for the faint of heart, but you can do it!</p>
    <p>
        Here's the closest transcription I could muster: /ˈftõo:rē:nə/.
    </p>
    <p>
        To begin with, the first <i>"V"</i> is actually pronounced as <i>f</i>, according to the phonetic rules of the Russian language.
        Then goes the <i>"tyu"</i> — long and soft, kind of like the word <i>"tu"</i> in French. The <i>"ri"</i> part is pronounced as <i>"reeh"</i>, like in <i>"reef"</i> or <i>"read"</i>. Finally, we close off with <i>"na"</i>, as in <i>"Hey, would you like to have a last name Vtyurina?" — "Nah, I'm good, thanks."</i>
    </p>
    <p>
        One last thing to know is that the <b>em</b>phasis <b>go</b>es on the first <b>syl</b>lable, not the em<b>pha</b>sis on the se<b>cond</b> syl<b>la</b>ble as is intuitive for most native English speakers.
