  <h1>Ahoy, internet traveller!</h1>
    <p>I am honoured by you visiting this website. My name is Sasha and these few pages contain lots of information about me.</p>

    <p> I have a great many interests in my life, but my current prime occupation is being a PhD student at the University of Waterloo in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. Throughout my PhD program I have been focusing on conversational and voice interactions between humans and computer systems. In particular, I have been studying how such interactions can be used to facilitate the process of information finding, and web search specifically. At one point, I endeavoured to explore how voice-based web search can be useful for people who are blind or visually impaired. </p>

        Our paper <a href="papers/vtyurina2020audioSerp.pdf">A Mixed-Method Analysis of Text and Audio Search Interfaces with Varying Task Complexity</a> was accepted at ICTIR 2020. In short, in it we ponder how one might represent a search result using an audio-only channel. By the way, I also recorded <a href="https://youtu.be/oH3yJE2dPs0">a talk for it</a>.

      <div class="content">Our paper <a href="papers/VERSE_ASSETS2019.pdf">VERSE: Bridging Screen Readers and Voice Assistants for Enhanced Eyes-Free Web Search</a> was accepted to ASSETS 2019. It received a best paper nomination (but not the award) which I was quite content about. At the time of acceptance it also generated some interest in the press:
